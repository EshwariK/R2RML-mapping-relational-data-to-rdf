# 128-R2RML: Mapping Relational Data to RDF
Welcome to our Seminar Topic, where we explore the fascinating realm of mapping relational data to RDF. In this seminar, we delve into two projects, each offering unique insights into R2RML mapping techniques.

## Getting started

Below, we present three exciting projects along with their respective links:

- [Lego](lego/README.md) - This project demonstrates an automated approach to mapping relational database (RDB) data to RDF format using **Ontop**.

- [Morph Kgc](morph-kgc/README.md) - This project demonstrates an automated approach to mapping relational database (RDB) data to RDF format using **morph-kgc**.
